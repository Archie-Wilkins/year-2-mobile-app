WhatsEvents ReadMe

Key features to look at:
- Logging in app supports multiple accounts (suggested is but could use) 
- Viewing events - select event from dashboard 
- Adding event (button in bottom right corner of dashboard) 
- Logging out top right 
- Sharing links to events (click on event from dashboard, scroll to the bottom of event info and click share button)
- Viewing events as an attendee (click on link sent with message to chosen place when sharing event info) 

The app was primarily tested in a RealMe7 Pro (real phone) 
App appeared to work well with Pixel 4 emulater (Ui didnt looked a little messier in parts but appeared fully functional)
