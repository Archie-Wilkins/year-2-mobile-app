The purpose of this application is to make events planning easier when using social-media platforms like WhatsApp. Many social media platforms do not have dedicated tools to plan events. This can be frustrating as event planning is often lost within general group chatter. The target market is small groups (4-10 ages 16+) planning small-scale events e.g. pub and cinema trips. 

To resolve this problem I propose to create a system that allows Event Organisers to create shareable event cards (images) which will better communicate all event information in one place (MVP). Ideally Event Organisers would be able share links to events where users can see event details and confirm their attendance status. The event attendees would not need to create an account but would be able to confirm their attendance status from a list of attendees created by the event organiser. From this screen attendees will also be able to see who else is going to the event. To further develop this, it would be ideal to have a means of allowing event organisers to also create events where users sign up rather than respond to an invitiation (i.e no present attendee list).
