The purpose of this application is to make events planning easier when using social-media platforms like WhatsApp. Many social media platforms do not have dedicated tools to plan events. This can be frustrating as event planning is often lost within general group chatter. The target market is small groups (4-10 ages 16+) planning small-scale events e.g. pub and cinema trips. 

To resolve this problem I propose to create a system that allows Event Organisers to create shareable event cards (images) which will better communicate all event information in one place (MVP). Ideally Event Organisers would be able share links to events where users can see event details and confirm their attendance status. The event attendees would not need to create an account but would be able to confirm their attendance status from a list of attendees created by the event organiser. From this screen attendees will also be able to see who else is going to the event. To further develop this, it would be ideal to have a means of allowing event organisers to also create events where users sign up rather than respond to an invitiation (i.e no present attendee list).

Formative comments from Sandy

Thanks for submitting your work for formative feedback! I hope that my comments are useful:

- It wasn't quite clear to me whether you intend to integrate with social media platforms (i.e., to overcome a limitation), or whether you are just noting their limitations as part of your motivation. Is it a standalone app or will there be integration with social media APIs?

– In general, I can see a need for this application, it's a hard task, especially once you get over more than a couple of people. I am going to be interested to see how you have addressed some of the challenges in the final version of the app!

- Think carefully about how you're going to stop this app from becoming a complex client-server system; the focus here has to be on the mobile app because that's where the marks are. Consider ways to minimize your time doing any development work outside Android SDK and third-party Android libraries. You might think about using Wizard of Oz for some of it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment

– Think about ways your can demonstrate the breadth of your experience with the Android APIs. Don't throw anything in for the sake of it, but do think of ways you can work in additional features (e.g., notifications, location) that make sense for the app and would let you demonstrate a wide variety of skills.
