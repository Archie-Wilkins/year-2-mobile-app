# Rough Plan 
Create an events app because trying to arrange events in whatsapp group chats is rather ineffective. 
Key features 
1. Create events that can be shared in some sort of conveninet manner 
2. Users sign up for events might be beyond project scope - just enter name dont need an account 
3. Users can accept and decline events

- Is database in project scope? 
- Is accounting for other users in scope? (They wouldnt need accounts just a means of accepting events) 
- Linking to app through external link? 

## Features 
- Event Card creation 
- Share events to friends via whatsapp 
- Friends can sign up for events 
- Friends can accept and decline events  
- Use from g-board keyboard?
