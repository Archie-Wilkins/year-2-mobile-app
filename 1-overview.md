The purpose of this application is to make events planning easier when using social-media platforms like whatsapp. Many social media platforms do not have dedicated tools to plan events often making it frustrating to organise groups as event planning is often lost within general chatter and important event details are often lost within long blocks of text or not included at all. The target market is small groups of friends planning small-scale events e.g. pub and cinema trips. 

To resolve this problem I propose to create a system that at the very least allows Event Organisers to create shareable event cards (images) which will better communicate all event information in one place and in a clearer manner than a long paragraph of text would. Ideally Event Organisers would be able share links to events where users can see event details and confirm their attendance status. The event attendees would not need to create an account but would be able to confirm their attendence status from a list of attendees created by the event organiser. From this screen attendees will also be able to see who else is going to the event. If time it would be ideal to have a means of allowing event organisers to create events where users sign up rather than respond to an invitiation.
