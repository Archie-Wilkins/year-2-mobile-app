During development I changed my MVP from focusing on creating sharable images with event details, to focusing on event organisation i.e. inviting users to events and allowing them to accept or decline via the app as I felt this was more valuable and enabled more possibilities for future iterations. 
With more time I'd add sharable images with event details, as this could be a unique selling point, and could evolve to become more like a personalisable event ticket to add novelty. 

On reflection, I should've spent more time wireframing. This would've saved additional code refactoring  later on, as there would've been a clearer vision for the intended outcome. Design software like Figma could've been used to quickly mock designs rather than designing in Android Studio, saving time. Having clearer intended outcomes also could've informed my code architecture. For example API calls to my client-side server are often repeated and therefore should've been placed into a service, preventing duplicate code. Throughout the project my app lacked a clear code strucutre. For example until mid-way through files were not organised making code navigation harder, slowing development. Likewise naming conventions and code commenting could have been better utilised to make code more readable.

– This will be tricky, but if you're able to, try and make more reference to specific technical differences you might have if you were starting from scratch. For example is there some other part of the Android API that, in retrospect, might have been useful for you? It'd be good to see this kind of technical decision-making coming through.

– I'd probably recommend being less negative about your code organisation, though I can see the benefits of doing that better, to make room to talk about other technical options.

- If there's any space for more details on your sharable images that would be good. Would these be auto-generated from event data, for example?
